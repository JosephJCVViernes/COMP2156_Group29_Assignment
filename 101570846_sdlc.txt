DevOps plays an important role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by improving collaboration between development and operations teams. In traditional models, these teams worked separately, often causing delays and inefficiencies.

By integrating DevOps practices into the SDLC, teams can automate testing, integration, and deployment. This leads to faster delivery cycles and more reliable software releases. Automation also reduces human error and improves consistency.

Learning DevOps is important because it connects development with deployment and maintenance. It encourages continuous improvement and faster innovation, making it a key skill in modern software engineering.
Testing is a critical phase in SDLC that ensures software quality.
Maintenance ensures the software remains functional after release.
